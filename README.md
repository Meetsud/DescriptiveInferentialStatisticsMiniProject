# DescriptiveInferentialStatisticsMiniProject
A hands-on project to understand and apply key statistical concepts like mean, median, mode, variance, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing, using real-world datasets and manual calculations.
# Descriptive and Inferential Statistics - Mini Project

This mini project presents concise definitions of key statistical concepts that form the foundation of data analysis. It is designed for students and beginners who are getting started with statistics and data science.

## üìå Project Overview

The objective of this project is to clearly explain the following fundamental concepts:

1. **Population and Sample**
2. **Descriptive and Inferential Statistics**
3. **Parameter and Statistic**
4. **Qualitative and Quantitative Data**

Each concept is explained in 2‚Äì3 lines for quick understanding.

## üìö Key Statistical Definitions

### a) Population and Sample

- **Population**: The complete set of all individuals or items that you're studying.
- **Sample**: A subset of the population selected for analysis to make inferences about the whole.

### b) Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Methods for summarizing and organizing data using measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
- **Inferential Statistics**: Techniques for drawing conclusions or making predictions about a population based on sample data.

### c) Parameter and Statistic

- **Parameter**: A numerical value that describes a characteristic of a population (e.g., population mean).
- **Statistic**: A numerical value that describes a characteristic of a sample (e.g., sample mean).

### d) Qualitative and Quantitative Data

- **Qualitative Data**: Non-numeric information that describes categories or labels (e.g., colors, names).
- **Quantitative Data**: Numeric data that represents measurable quantities (e.g., height, weight).
